## LDA stuff
+ pyro ELBO_tracenum
  + gaussian LDA with SVI
+ or just write ourselves

## pretrained word vectors
+ find pretrained
+ find fitters

--- 
Tried:
separately trained word2vec word vectors for neural variational topic model
  + freeze = true, don't learn vectors
running Gaussian LDA with GloVe

## 11/4

Synchronize 20newsgroups preprocess between us and Das et al.
  - Just use their setup, their vocab. 
  - we couldn't load the vocab.txt to colab; have to work locally?
  - one way out -- gaussian Lda with pyro in colab
Keep poking the neural lda model
